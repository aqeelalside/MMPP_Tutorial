<p>Large collections of documents contain useful information, but finding the specific documents or sections of documents that matter in individual cases can be time-consuming and difficult. Unicorn solves this problem by providing a user-friendly interface to search through large collections of documents, quickly view documents of any file type in the browser, and suggest other documents that may be related. Unicorn is intended to ease the analysis of large collections of documents. It can assist with many types of document analysis, allowing you to triage large document stores, discover new information, and generate leads for next steps in a document investigation. </p>

<p>Once an analyst has found a document relevant to their investigation, Unicorn helps the analyst identify the next steps to take in their investigation. It has several built in functions centered on the purpose of organizing data for the user so that they may more effectively use their intuition and experience to make connections and identify patterns between a vast corpus of documents. In depth details of each particular function can be found further below, but the general workflow is as follows:</p>

<p>1) User uploads their corpus of documents</p> 

<p>2) Enters a query into the search barâ€“ Unicorn does a 'smart' search across all uploaded documents </p>

<p>3) User selects particular function and proceeds with analysis on the desired aspects</p>

<p>Each function listed below displays an amount of summary information about the retrieved documents: </p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a timeline</li>
  <li>the documents themselves</li>
  <li>a word cloud</li>
  <li>a list of topics</li>
  <li>a list of extracted entities</li>
  <li>a network graph of the extracted entities</li>
  <li>a map of mentioned locations</li>
  
</ul>
